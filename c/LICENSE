The vast majority of this implementation is subject to the standard
3-clause BSD license. Copyright is held by Three Rings Design and
Landon Fuller, and the license and official copyright can be found at
the bottom of this file.

Some code has been integrated from various sources, including:
	- kazlib (list and hash table implementations)
	- heimdal kerberos (base64 implementation and tests)

Associated copyrights and licenses are documented below. You'll find that they
are all compatible and as permissive as the standard BSD license -- in fact,
most are simply small variations on the license.
